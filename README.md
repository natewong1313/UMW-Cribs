# Web App Template

This is my go-to preconfigured starter kit for building any web-app MVP

Features:

- Backend server written in Go using Fiber as the http server
- Frontend using React with Vite + Tailwind CSS for styling + Eslint & Prettier configs
- Custom component library for React
- Firebase for auth
